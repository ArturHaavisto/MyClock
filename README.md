# MyClock

## About

This is my project to create a clock app that I like. I don't like how other clock or timer apps work, so I want to try if I can create a better one. My main goal is to create a decent timer, but I may create stopwatch and other stuff too.

## Techonologies

- Kotlin
- Jetpack compose
